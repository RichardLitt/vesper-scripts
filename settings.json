      "text": "BAWW NFCs are generally distinctive and easy to identify. They are two-parted, with a dip in the beginning and a level area at the end. Ruling out similar species follows this rubric:\n(1) Two parted (rules out NOWA, LOWA, KEWA, CSWA). If two-partedness does not involve tail, rules out BWWA. If two-partedness does not include modulation changes, rules out GWWA.\n(2) Wavelength under 4.1mS (rules out NOWA, LOWA, KEWA, CSWA)\n(3) More than 10 waves (rules out NOWA, LOWA, BLPW, KEWA).",
