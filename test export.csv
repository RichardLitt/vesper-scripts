Canada Warbler,,,1,"1 NFC. Canada Warblers have a distinctively shaped call, with an initial V dropping down to 4kHz~, then leveling out to 6.5k±5Hz, with light modulation with a depth of 750Hz~ and two to five humps. Any depth of the V less than 3.4kHz can rule out WIWA and COYE, and a length longer than 40mS can rule out WIWA.  All NFC calls identified here follow this pattern, unless noted. If the number of identified calls does not match the NFC count, it is because the calls occurred close enough to each other to make it unclear whether or not a single bird was calling.

Bay-breasted Warbler,,,2,"2 NFC. Bay-breasted Warblers have a tseep-like call, with two humps, level or slightly descending, with a wavelength of 19mS+, a frequency of 7.2±.6kHz, single- or lightly double-banded, length of 60±10mS, unless otherwise noted. Landsborough (2017) found BBWA was the only warbler in the tseep complex which gave a call over 19mS in wavelength. All NFC calls identified here follow this pattern, unless noted.
